Abstract:
This paper explores the role of network effects in international trade, focusing on value chain length as a novel metric within the Global Value Chain literature. Traditional trade theories, such as the Ricardian model, emphasize comparative advantage and industrial specialization, where countries allocate resources to their most efficient industries. However, this model overlooks the importance of complementarity in production, which generates gains from industrial variety and interconnected value chains. The paper contrasts Ricardian trade policy with industrial policies that promote variety and complex value chains.

This article finds that industrial network complexity is a source of comparative advantage in trade. Specifically, importers source from areas with more densely connected industries, a factor not explained by traditional sources of comparative advantage. The novel implication is that industrial specialization in relative comparative advantage can paradoxically lead to a trade disadvantage. The paper hypothesizes that the expansion of global value chains (GVCs) increases demand for skilled labor, especially in developed countries. Using an instrumental variables approach, the study finds that longer value chains cause skill effects, further supporting the idea that value chain length is a measure of technology.
